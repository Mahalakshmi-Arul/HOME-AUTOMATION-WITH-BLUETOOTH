# HOME_AUTOMATION_WITH_BLUETOOTH

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: MAHALAKSHMI A

*INTERN ID*: CT04DA198

*DOMAIN*: EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: Implemented a Bluetooth-controlled light ON/OFF system using an Arduino Uno. The project uses the HC-05 Bluetooth module to receive commands from a smartphone app. Based on the received input ('1' or '0'), the Arduino controls a relay module connected to a 230V AC light. A serial monitor is also used to log received commands for debugging purposes.

*KEY FEATURES*:
   ➤ Receives ON/OFF commands via Bluetooth using the HC-05 module.
   ➤ Controls a 230V AC light through a relay module based on received commands.
   ➤ Uses SoftwareSerial to communicate with the HC-05 module on pins 10 (RX) and 11 (TX).
   ➤ Implements simple condition checks (if statements) for command parsing.
   ➤ Uses the Serial Monitor for debugging and viewing the received Bluetooth commands.
   ➤ Initializes relay to OFF state during startup to ensure safety.
   ➤ Clean and minimal logic for beginner-friendly understanding and modular expansion.

*PERIPHERALS USED*:
  •Arduino UNO R3 Module
  • Relay Module (connected to digital pin 8)
  • HC-05 Bluetooth Module
  • 230V AC Light connected through relay NO-COM terminals
  • Serial Monitor (for real-time command logging)
